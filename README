WARNING: NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!!


About:
This is the vendor/device tree for the Dell Streak. This can be built using Code Aurora's Froyo Source (2.2.1 FRG83). This project is at a very early alpha stage and there are still a lot of issues to resolve. See list below.

Goal:
The goal of this project is to provide a stock Google Experience with as little deviation as possible from the original Android Source. Eventually, switching to Google's source tree would be preferred.

Get the source:
Code Aurora Git Web: https://www.codeaurora.org/gitweb/quic/la/
Download Froyo Source from Code Aurora using Google's Repo Command: repo init -u git://codeaurora.org/platform/manifest.git -b froyo

Compile:
Copy this directory to the root of the build environment: device/dell/streak/
At the top level, issue the command: make or copy compile_streak to the root of the build environment and run.
